# Relational Database

{I'm storing data extracted from IMBD. Specifically Movies, Actors, Genres, directors, and writers.}

{The way its structured is that all the tables are branched from the movie table. The actors, directors, genre, and writers branch off.}

# Development Environment

{I used SQL syntax, The website IMBD, and a tutorial on how to import SQL to python.  }

{The programming language that I used was mainly SQL using a MYSQL database and I imported that information from MySQL to VSCode using python}
