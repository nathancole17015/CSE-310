# Overview
{Using Python I created a password manager. It uses tkinter to create a GUI for a user to interact with. It also uses encryption and decryption for the passwords. }

{The purpose was to get more used to creating a GUI using python. Also learning out to encrypt and decrypt }

# Development Environment

{Within the program I used tkinter which built in python to create the gui. I also used AI to solve some problems with the code. }

{I didn't want to make it too complicated so I just used python and within it tkinter }

# Future Work

- A way to store the passwords. So when the code is ran again it can get those passwords
- A better look more pleasing to the eye
- A drop down box for a what the password is used for. ex. personal,company,shopping
