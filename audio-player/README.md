# Overview

{For this project I wanted to create an webapp audio player using the coding language React. I never used React before but have created websites with javascript in the past.}

{My webapp audio player allows a user to play a audio file. With will show the name and artist of the audio file. You'll be able to skip forward and back 15 seconds. You'll also be able to skip or skim the audio file. To start the sever all you'll have to do is get in the audio-player directory and then in the terminal npm start.}

{I wanted to demonstrate an ability to code in the coding language of react.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

{There's currently only web page but multiple audio files that you can skip to.}

# Development Environment

{I used the some examples of audio player other have used . I used the websites to see react's library and how to use it. }

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Useful Websites


* [LogRocket: Fronted Analytics ](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-icons-comprehensive-tutorial-examples/)
* [React](https://react.dev/)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would have liked a way to add more songs
* Be abl to look through the files to find audio file
* Make it useable on a mobile device
