# Overview



{The program that I created was similar to the dinosaur game played on google chrome when the page isn't loaded. It jumps over a block when clicking on the screen. If the block does not jump in time then the game stop until restarted. I used html, css , and javascript to create to this fun little game. }

{The purpose of this program was to demonstrate what I learned in Javascript. And demonstrate by creating a game.}
